Securing API with JWT

I understand the concept of JWT(Json Web Token) and how it works for REST APIs.

The thing is, in order to get the token, a user needs to authenticate(user and password), right?

How is that authentication secured and verified?
I know securing the channel(using HTTPS) is the first thing, but, if the following communications needs to be secured, authorized and authenticated; How is it possible the authentication part is not strongly secured?

Am I missing anything? Or is there anything else to secure the authentication step?
